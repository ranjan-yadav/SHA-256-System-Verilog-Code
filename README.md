# SHA-256-System-Verilog-Code
The complete code for SHA-256 has been implemented on questasim using system verilog and output has been for 256-random input given by user. For verification with real output , I have used an online website link as follows: https://www.movable type.co.uk/scripts/sha256.html , which generates the SHA-256 output for a message.
